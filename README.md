HARVEST PREDICTION

Current agricultural practices lack efficient maturity assessment techniques, causing suboptimal harvesting times and reduced postharvest quality. Manual methods are labor-intensive and subjective, leading to delayed interventions and yield loss risks. The absence of real-time maturity data hinders proactive decision-making, limiting productivity and sustainability. Inaccurate assessments compromise yield potential and market value, highlighting the need for improved maturity analysis methods.


ALGORITHM:

ResNet50 AlgorithmResNet50, part of the Residual Networks (ResNet) family, is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture known for its exceptional performance in image classification tasks. Introduced by Kaiming He et al. in 2015, ResNet50 won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) due to its innovative design, which addresses the challenges of training deep networks.

Key Features:

Depth and Structure:

50 Layers: ResNet50 consists of 50 layers, making it a deep model capable of capturing complex patterns in image data.
Building Blocks: It utilizes a series of convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activations, and pooling layers to process images.

Residual Learning:

Residual Blocks: The core innovation in ResNet50 is the use of residual blocks, which include "skip connections" that bypass one or more layers.Identity Mapping: These skip connections allow the network to learn identity mappings, making it easier to train very deep networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.Equation: If ( H(x) ) is the desired mapping, ResNet lets layers fit ( F(x) = H(x) - x ) instead, and outputs ( F(x) + x ).

Performance:

High Accuracy: ResNet50 achieves high accuracy in image recognition tasks and is less prone to overfitting compared to shallower networks.
Transfer Learning: The architecture's pre-trained models are commonly used for transfer learning, enabling their application to new tasks with limited data.

Applications:

Image Classification: Identifying objects or features within images.
Feature Extraction: Used in various computer vision tasks like segmentation and object detection.
